# Codename: Mercury

This project is currently in active development. This readme will be updated when the project is complete.

## Technology

This app was built with [React](https://reactjs.org/), [React Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/), [Redux-Saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/), [Redux Form](https://redux-form.com/), [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/), [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios), [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/), [Sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/), & [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/)

## Concept

A website that provides a place for recruiters to see students enrolled in a coding bootcamp, see the students' most recent GitHub repositories, leave comments for individual students, and post jobs. The students can see comments left for them by recruiters, see posted jobs, and save them for later.

## Motivation

This project was an exercise to build a larger-scale, full-stack React website. I wanted to use this as an opportunity to become more familiar with libraries at tools that are being used in modern React apps.
